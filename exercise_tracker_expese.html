    <h1>Shared Expense Tracker.</h1>

    <p>A simple plan for a simple project.</p>
    <p>Creating a plan step by step.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Having a form where you register your user</li>
        <li>Being able to log in as a user</li>
        <li>Using the localStorage for this purpose</li>
        <li>Creating a button that allows to delete all the data from the localStorage (Only for the supreme adim - Myself!!!)</li>
        <li>Tracking the expenses of all the users</li>
        <li>Sharing the expenses so that if a user spent 20 Reais, and we have 4 users for example:
            <ol>
                <li>The user who spent 20 reais has a credit of 20 reais</li>
                <li>User 2,3,4 are in debt of 6.67 euro with the creditor</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Display past transactions only if you login as the supreme user Andrea Edson The Magnificient</li>
    </ul>

        CSS:
        <li>Make the interface responsive ussing CSS media queries</li>
